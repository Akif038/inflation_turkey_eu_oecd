# inflation_turkey_eu_oecd
I got the data from https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-cpi.htm. What I observe in this data set is that Turkey faces traumatic and higher inflation than OECD and EU countries. In the last 8 months, The Central Bank of Turkey lowered its primary interest rate, which triggered a jump in the exchange rates. Since Turkey is highly dependent on the intermediate goods in its exports, the increase in the exchange rates has increased the cost of production dramatically. As a result, Turkey became one of the main inflationist countries in the world.
